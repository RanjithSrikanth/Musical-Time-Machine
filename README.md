# Musical-Time-Machine
A mini-project that utilizes web scraping and the Spotipy API. Given a specific year as input, it extracts the top 100 songs from the Billboard website and employs Spotipy to generate a playlist containing these top tracks. This project offers a nostalgic journey through time by curating playlists that capture the musical essence of a chosen year.
